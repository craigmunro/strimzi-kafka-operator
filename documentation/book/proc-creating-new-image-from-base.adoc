[id='creating-new-image-from-base-{context}']
= Create a new image based on our base image

{ProductName} provides its own container image for running Kafka Connect, which can be found on {DockerRepository} as
`{DockerKafkaConnect}`.
The `{DockerKafkaConnect}` image is configured to automatically load all plugins or connectors that are present in the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory during startup.
This image can be used as a base image for building a new custom image with additional plugins.

The following procedure describes the process for creating such a custom image and adding the connector plugins to the the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory.

.Procedure

. Create a new `Dockerfile` using `{DockerKafkaConnect}` as the base image:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
FROM {DockerKafkaConnect}
USER root:root
COPY ./_my-plugins_/ /opt/kafka/plugins/
USER {DockerImageUser}
----

. Build the container image and upload it to the appropriate container image repository.

. Set the `KafkaConnect.spec.image` property of the KafkaConnect custom resource or the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE` variable to point to the new container image.
